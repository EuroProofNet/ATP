# EuroProofNet WG2 on Automated Theorem Provers

<img alt="" style="border-width:0" width="45%" align="left" src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/469755587/a181ecd6-d2ce-4921-a4ad-94c249a569cc"> [EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/) is the European research network on digital proofs. EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems. EuroProofNet is a [COST action](https://www.cost.eu/) started on November 2021 gathering more than 220 researchers from 30 different countries.

The aim of [working group 2 (WG 2)](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2/) is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with a higher need of coordination.

This repository collects material and documentation of project deliverables related to WG2. The contents are listed below.

## Wiki on ATPs

The working group maintains an inventory of theorem provers, which can be found at the **[GitHub Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ATP/wiki)**.

*The wiki is ongoing work towards deliverable D3 [see the MoU of COST action CA20111](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20111/).*
