# Repository of EuroProofNet WG2 on Automated Theorem Provers (ATP)

EuroProofNet is the European research network on digital proofs. EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems. EuroProofNet is a COST action started on November 2021 gathering more than 220 researchers from 30 different countries.

The aim of this WG is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with a higher need of coordination.
