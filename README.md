# Repository of EuroProofNet WG2 on Automated Theorem Provers (ATP)

[EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/) is the European research network on digital proofs. EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems. EuroProofNet is a [COST action](https://www.cost.eu/) started on November 2021 gathering more than 220 researchers from 30 different countries.

The aim of working group 2 (WG 2) is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with a higher need of coordination.

## Wiki on ATPs

The working group maintains an inventory of theorem provers, which can be found at the [GitHub Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ATP/wiki).
